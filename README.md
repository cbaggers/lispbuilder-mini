lispbuilder-mini
================

This is intended to be a stripped down version of the fantastic 
lispbuilder package. I have personally found it a bit too bulky 
and loaded with magic and I would like to see what areas can 
be made thinner and more transparent.

It will be mainly focussed around using sdl for modern opengl 
programming and will leave scene graphs and such to other packages.

I'll update this readme when there is anything new and interesting here!

Forked from a Git conversion of lispbuilder's SVN repository.
